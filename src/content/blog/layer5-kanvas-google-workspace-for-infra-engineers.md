## Introduction

Just as Google Workspace revolutionized team productivity by enabling seamless real-time collaboration on documents, sheets, and slides, Layer5 Kanvas is transforming how infrastructure engineers and DevOps teams work with cloud native systems. Kanvas provides a collaborative canvas for designing, configuring, and managing Kubernetes and multi-cloud infrastructures—turning complex YAML files and command-line operations into an intuitive, shared visual experience.

Layer5 itself describes Kanvas as delivering "a collaborative experience for engineers similar to how Google Workspace transforms the digital work environment."

## What is Layer5 Kanvas?

Layer5 Kanvas is a web-based visual designer and collaborative platform built on the open-source Meshery project. It allows teams to create, share, and orchestrate diagrams of cloud native infrastructure using drag-and-drop components representing Kubernetes resources, service meshes, cloud services, and more.

Key capabilities include:
- Thousands of versioned, semantic components (Deployments, Services, Ingresses, etc.)
- Real-time multi-user editing and collaboration
- Import from existing configs (Kubernetes manifests, Helm charts, Docker Compose)
- Configuration panels for fine-tuning components
- Versioning, sharing, and embedding of designs
- Integration with Meshery for deployment and operations

## Real-Time Collaboration Like Google Docs

One of the strongest parallels to Google Workspace is Kanvas's real-time collaboration:

- Multiple engineers can edit the same infrastructure design simultaneously
- Changes appear instantly for all participants
- Add comments and conduct design reviews directly on the canvas
- Team workspaces with access controls and organizational hierarchy

This eliminates the bottlenecks of emailing YAML files back and forth or merging conflicting pull requests—just like how Google Docs ended version chaos in document collaboration.

## Drag-and-Drop Design Like Building Slides or Sheets

Infrastructure design in Kanvas feels familiar:

- Drag components from a rich palette onto the canvas
- Connect them to define relationships
- Configure properties in side panels
- Use freestyle drawing for annotations or custom diagrams

It's as intuitive as arranging elements in Google Slides or organizing data in Sheets, but for Pods, Services, and cloud resources instead of text and charts.

## Unified Workspace for Teams

Kanvas, powered by Layer5 Cloud, provides:

- Centralized catalog of public and private designs/patterns
- Team management and permissions
- Version history and sharing controls
- Embeddable interactive designs in docs or wikis

Much like Google Workspace's shared drives, calendars, and apps—all infrastructure artifacts live in one collaborative environment.

## From Design to Deployment

While Google Workspace focuses on content creation, Kanvas goes further by bridging design and operations:

- Deploy designs directly via Meshery
- Validate configurations
- Manage running workloads visually

This closes the loop for infrastructure engineers, making Kanvas a complete platform for the entire lifecycle.

## Conclusion

In an era of increasingly complex cloud native environments, Layer5 Kanvas brings the simplicity and collaboration of Google Workspace to infrastructure teams. By replacing fragmented tools and text-heavy configs with a visual, real-time collaborative platform, Kanvas empowers engineers to design, review, and operate infrastructure more efficiently—together.

If you're tired of wrestling with YAML sprawl, give Kanvas a try and experience the future of collaborative infrastructure management.
